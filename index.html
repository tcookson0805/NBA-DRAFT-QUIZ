        <div class='question'>He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. 
        I like text that wasn’t captured. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, 
        perhaps I’d be dating it. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes 
        better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. 
        I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make 
        Google pay for that text. Mark my words. We are going to make placeholder text great 
        again. Greater than ever before.</div>
